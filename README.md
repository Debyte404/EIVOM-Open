# 🎬 Eivom

Welcome to **Eivom**, my first personal project! This website is a comprehensive movie database and recommendation platform built using a variety of technologies including Python, JavaScript, MongoDB Atlas, Gemini API, TMDB API, OMDB API, HTML, and CSS.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **APIs**: TMDB API, OMDB API, Gemini API

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Trending Movies**: Uses the TMDB database to fetch trending movies.
- **Movie Search and Data**: Utilizes the OMDB API for searching and retrieving movie details.
- **User Data Management**: MongoDB Atlas stores user credentials and movie lists. Passwords are hashed for security, ensuring even the server cannot access them.

## 📱 Responsiveness

The website is designed to be responsive on mobile devices, although it may not be fully optimized for all screen sizes.

## 🎉 Fun Fact

The name **Eivom** is a playful twist on the word "movie" spelled backward, symbolizing the reverse engineering of the movie-watching experience.
